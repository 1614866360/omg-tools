- dual initialisation: first compose correct basis of lambda.
    int_0^T (l(t) * c(t)) = l_cfs^T*c_cfs
    also mu initialisation: dual slackness = l_cfs^T*c_cfs

+ rewrite shift_1knot with explicit transformation matrix, based on knot insertion
+ shift knot bw
- rewrite shift_over_knot with extrapolation and knot insertion
- make test script with used tf's
- check how to deal with mu if there are non-spline inequalities (which are not shifted)
- think of good way to implement tf's (of duals) in toolbox

??
- dual infeasibility mostly not the same as the one of last iteration prev problem
- mu: this is h_i*l_i right? This is not equal for all (some serious outliers)
- dual var is sometimes negative??

Notes:
* All SX symbol names are unique!
* Local names (defined in a child) are not, but are human readable
* All child-labels are unique! OptiLayer should guard this and change the label
* Unique translation from SX symbol name to [child, local name, index]
* Opposite is not true! This due to symbols: multiple SX symbols can point to
  1 [child, local name, index].
