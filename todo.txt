ADMM
- rewrite shiftFirstKnotFwd with knot insertion
- multiple knots inside: does this still work?

Toolbox
+ solve issue with create function -> only jit for SX
+ write update for distr problem (environment??)
+ rewrite fleet
+ admm: initial iterations
+ clean up basis stuff
- overlook plots
    - getVehicleTypes?
    - vehicle index?
- compute objective + average and max update time
- compare 2 initial values
- build only once per vehicle type
- implement stability shzl upd z
- parameters for interaction constraints (rel formation...)
- clean up spline_extra

- worries
    + environment defines constraints on already multiple vehicles
    - vehicle index... does it still mean something?

Notes:
* All SX symbol names are unique!
* Local names (defined in a child) are not, but are human readable
* All child-labels are unique! OptiLayer should guard this and change the label
* Unique translation from SX symbol name to [child, local name, index]
* Opposite is not true! This due to symbols: multiple SX symbols can point to
  1 [child, local name, index].
