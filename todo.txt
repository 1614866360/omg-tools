? build only once per vehicle type
? dual initialization. What is the meaning of the dual vars of the corresponding
  relaxed primal problem?? This is probably one of the millenium questions...

- embedded export for single vehicle system
    - run in orocos component
        + debug every possible line
        + debug in motion planning toolbox why problem is infeasible? probably wrong stat0, stateT hmm or inputT (is this initialized??)
        + does everything works ok if number of states > n_st ?
        - try with estimated pose from teensy
        - check required build options in orocos
        + what happens when restarting/resetting? Internal state/input not reset?
    - vehicle trajectory: list of lists
    - add all makefile options as options of export
    - name + github page for toolbox
    - license for toolbox

- admm: reorganize such that initial transformation information can be stored

Notes:
* All SX symbol names are unique!
* Local names (defined in a child) are not, but are human readable
* All child-labels are unique! OptiLayer should guard this and change the label
* Unique translation from SX symbol name to [child, local name, index]
* Opposite is not true! This due to symbols: multiple SX symbols can point to
  1 [child, local name, index].
