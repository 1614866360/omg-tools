? build only once per vehicle type
? dual initialization. What is the meaning of the dual vars of the corresponding
  relaxed primal problem?? This is probably one of the millenium questions...

- embedded export for single vehicle system
    + export casadi problem in python/import in c++
        + setParameters
        + updateBounds
        + initVariables
        + check variables/parameters/bounds
        + initialize _everything_ (structs...), otherwise nasty errors
    + try to automize get_y, based on state and input. only if casadi supports
      symbolic solving of (non linear) systems. you can also solve it by creating
      define_y() where u and x are given (and perform check if correct + degree shzl)
        + test also with model/plant mismatch
    + write odeint function (runge kutta...)
    + write function which evaluate spline and derivatives up to n_der
    + write ideal predict and compare with runge kutta
    + update c++ code such that user only needs to think of state/input
    + spline transformation..
    - test all implemented functions
        - something wrong: 2nd iteration: derivatives of y[1] are wrong!
    - make knot_time depending on horizonTime via n_knots: make it possible to change horizonTime at run-time
    - environment parameters: pos/vel/acc of checkpoints (shape can be determined by uper obstacle tracker)
    - integrate obstacles

    + export differential equation, modelled in python toolbox
    + find ways in c++ to:
        + evaluate b-splines
        + integrate ode's

- admm: reorganize such that initial transformation information can be stored

QUESTIONS JORIS
- c++ problem options: limited number of options?
- c++ how to cast solution to vector?
- c++ how to get solver output?

Notes:
* All SX symbol names are unique!
* Local names (defined in a child) are not, but are human readable
* All child-labels are unique! OptiLayer should guard this and change the label
* Unique translation from SX symbol name to [child, local name, index]
* Opposite is not true! This due to symbols: multiple SX symbols can point to
  1 [child, local name, index].
