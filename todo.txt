ADMM
- rewrite shiftFirstKnotFwd with knot insertion
- multiple knots inside: does this still work?

Toolbox
- subfolders in motionplanning

- rewrite for casadi 2.4
- give solver ipopt as option (codegen)


+ guard label uniqueness
+ get_variable, get_parameter, get_symbol -> give back symbolic MX's
+ get_variable, ... should return splines
+ everything becomes sx
+ test on symbols done while constructing problem?
+ think on how environment should be copied with other label: solved now by
  providing copy() method in Environment

- rewrite OptiLayer: results are stored on OptiLayer level...
  if you have multiple groups this crashes. OptiLayer object gets some children
    * define OptiLayer class: gets the children and all previous class methods
    * childeren are of type Opti
    * composition of dictionary only in the end?

  try to avoid class methods/attributes/...
- point2point has construct_problem in __init__...
- transform variables for objective

- worries
    - environment defines constraints on already multiple vehicles
    - should admm be part of a children group? Yes, I think it should: it
      defines objective part and has parameters.

+ create dictionary system: symbol_name:[child, local name]
    symbol name is unique, local name not!

Notes/desires:
* All SX symbol names are unique!
* Local names (defined in a child) are not, but are human readable
* All child-labels are unique! OptiLayer should guard this and change the label
* Unique translation from SX symbol name to [child, local name, index]
* Opposite is not true! This due to symbols: multiple SX symbols can point to
  1 [child, local name, index].

If we can retrieve a subset of the symbol_dict, we can act on single group:
create group constraints/variables/parameters
