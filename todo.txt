ADMM
- rewrite shiftFirstKnotFwd with knot insertion
- multiple knots inside: does this still work?

Toolbox
+ communication admm
+ updaters should get neighbors, not vehicles
- test everything
- better admm formulation?
- rendezvous

- subfolders in motionplanning

+ guard label uniqueness
- think on how environment should be copied with other label...

- worries
    - environment defines constraints on already multiple vehicles
    - should admm be part of a children group? Yes, I think it should: it
      defines objective part and has parameters.

+ create dictionary system: symbol_name:[child, local name]
    symbol name is unique, local name not!

Notes/desires:
* All MX symbol names are unique!
* Local names (defined in a child) are not, but are human readable
* All child-labels are unique! OptiLayer should guard this and change the label
* Unique translation from MX symbol name to [child, local name]
* Opposite is not true! This due to symbols: multiple MX symbols can point to
  1 [child, local name].

If we can retrieve a subset of the symbol_dict, we can act on single group:
create group constraints/variables/parameters
