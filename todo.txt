ADMM
- rewrite shiftFirstKnotFwd with knot insertion
- multiple knots inside: does this still work?

Toolbox
- init variables based on init variables of children
- check on linear eq constr based on jacobian, also G matrix = jacobian

- worries
    - environment defines constraints on already multiple vehicles
    - vehicle index... does it still mean something?

Notes:
* All SX symbol names are unique!
* Local names (defined in a child) are not, but are human readable
* All child-labels are unique! OptiLayer should guard this and change the label
* Unique translation from SX symbol name to [child, local name, index]
* Opposite is not true! This due to symbols: multiple SX symbols can point to
  1 [child, local name, index].
