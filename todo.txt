ADMM
- rewrite shiftFirstKnotFwd with knot insertion
- multiple knots inside: does this still work?

Toolbox
- make interprete_constraints in distributedProblem, where also dependency
  of symbols and their indices is determined.
- change optilayer for mx and try joris' trick for getting indices.
+ check on dictionary addition: no 2 symbol names allowed!
+ indices have to be sorted!
+ s_i not necessary
+ x_i based on get_variable (maybe in apart method)
+ q_ji_struct, q_ij_struct
- multiple build names
- check on linear eq constr based on jacobian, also G matrix = jacobian

- transform variables for objective
- worries
    - environment defines constraints on already multiple vehicles
    - should admm be part of a children group? Yes, I think it should: it
      defines objective part and has parameters.
- vehicle index... does it still mean something?

Notes:
* All SX symbol names are unique!
* Local names (defined in a child) are not, but are human readable
* All child-labels are unique! OptiLayer should guard this and change the label
* Unique translation from SX symbol name to [child, local name, index]
* Opposite is not true! This due to symbols: multiple SX symbols can point to
  1 [child, local name, index].
