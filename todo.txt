? build only once per vehicle type
? dual initialization. What is the meaning of the dual vars of the corresponding
  relaxed primal problem?? This is probably one of the millenium questions...

+ check if keeping duals keeps complementary slackness: of course not. After shift l_i*c_i =/= 0 anymore. So this is not a 'perfect' initial guess. This is what you want: transformation such that transformed c coeffs (coeffs in b-spline basis) and transformed l coeffs (unknown) have zero complementary slackness: this is a feasible dual solution.
+ shift_over_knot with repeated knots
- embedded export for single vehicle system
- admm: reorganize such that initial transformation information can be stored

Notes:
* All SX symbol names are unique!
* Local names (defined in a child) are not, but are human readable
* All child-labels are unique! OptiLayer should guard this and change the label
* Unique translation from SX symbol name to [child, local name, index]
* Opposite is not true! This due to symbols: multiple SX symbols can point to
  1 [child, local name, index].
