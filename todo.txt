Notes:
* All SX symbol names are unique!
* Local names (defined in a child) are not, but are human readable
* All child-labels are unique! OptiLayer should guard this and change the label
* Unique translation from SX symbol name to [child, local name, index]
* Opposite is not true! This due to symbols: multiple SX symbols can point to
  1 [child, local name, index].
