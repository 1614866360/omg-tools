ADMM
- rewrite shiftFirstKnotFwd with knot insertion
- multiple knots inside: does this still work?

Toolbox
? build only once per vehicle type
- spline_extra: still take a look to shift_over_knot and its assumption...
- dual initialisation: first compose correct basis of lambda.
    int_0^T (l(t) * c(t)) = l_cfs^T*c_cfs
    also mu initialisation: dual slackness = l_cfs^T*c_cfs

Notes:
* All SX symbol names are unique!
* Local names (defined in a child) are not, but are human readable
* All child-labels are unique! OptiLayer should guard this and change the label
* Unique translation from SX symbol name to [child, local name, index]
* Opposite is not true! This due to symbols: multiple SX symbols can point to
  1 [child, local name, index].
